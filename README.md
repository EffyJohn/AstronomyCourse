# AstronomyCourse

Each folder labelled by assignment number contains the files relevant to my Assignment submission for the "Introduction to Astronomy and Astrophysics" course I took in the second semester of my second year at BITS.

MATLAB code is stored as is in a folder named as such, one needs to simply copy that folder, ensuring that all files remain in the same folder, and run the astro.m file in MATLAB.

MATLAB code was written using the MATLAB online and MATLAB Desktop versions given out by Mathworks for student use, under the BITS Pilani License. All use of the application and the site have been in accordance to the guidelines for use provided by MATLAB.
